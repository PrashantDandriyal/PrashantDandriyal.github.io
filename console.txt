TISDK setup script
This script will set up your development host for SDK development.
Parts of this script require administrator priviliges (sudo access).

Verifying Linux host distribution
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04, or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is being used, continuing..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 serial devices are only accessible by members of the 'dialout' group.
A user must be apart of this group to have the proper permissions to access a serial device.

User 'pradan' is already apart of the 'dialout' group

This step will set up minicom (serial communication application) for
SDK development


For boards that contain a USB-to-Serial converter on the board such as:
	* BeagleBone
	* Beaglebone Black
	* AM335x EVM-SK
	* AM57xx EVM
	* K2H, K2L, and K2E EVMs

the port used for minicom will be automatically detected. By default Ubuntu
will not recognize this device. Setup will add a udev rule to
/etc/udev/ so that from now on it will be recognized as soon as the board is
plugged in.

For other boards, the serial will defualt to /dev/ttyS0. Please update based
on your setup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: If your using any of the above boards simply hit enter
and the correct port will be determined automatically at a
later step.  For all other boards select the serial port
that the board is connected to.
Which serial port do you want to use with minicom?
[ /dev/ttyS0 ] 
Copied existing /home/pradan/.minirc.dfl to /home/pradan/.minirc.dfl.old

Configuration saved to /home/pradan/.minirc.dfl. You can change it further from inside
minicom, see the Software Development Guide for more information.

This step will set up minicom (serial communication application) for
SDK development


For boards that contain a USB-to-Serial converter on the board such as:
	* BeagleBone
	* Beaglebone Black
	* AM335x EVM-SK
	* AM57xx EVM
	* K2H, K2L, and K2E EVMs

the port used for minicom will be automatically detected. By default Ubuntu
will not recognize this device. Setup will add a udev rule to
/etc/udev/ so that from now on it will be recognized as soon as the board is
plugged in.

For other boards, the serial will defualt to /dev/ttyS0. Please update based
on your setup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: If your using any of the above boards simply hit enter
and the correct port will be determined automatically at a
later step.  For all other boards select the serial port
that the board is connected to.
Which serial port do you want to use with minicom?
[ /dev/ttyS0 ] 

Copied existing /home/pradan/.minirc.dfl to /home/pradan/.minirc.dfl.old

Configuration saved to /home/pradan/.minirc.dfl. You can change it further from inside
minicom, see the Software Development Guide for more information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This step will set up the u-boot variables for booting the EVM.

################################################################################
The local.conf configuration file has been created for you with some
default values.  Please verify the contents of your conf/local.conf
file for correctness.

By default the number of threads used by the build is set to the number
of CPUs found on your system.

NOTE: You will probably want to change the default MACHINE setting in the
      local.conf file to the machine you are trying to build.



################################################################################
A setenv file has been created for you in the conf directory.  Please verify
The contents of this file.  Once you have verified the contents please source
this file to configure your environment for building:

    . conf/setenv

You can then start building using the bitbake command.  You will likely want
to set the MACHINE option if you have not done so in your local.conf file.

For example:
    MACHINE=xxxxx bitbake <target>

Common targets are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-sato
    meta-toolchain
    meta-toolchain-sdk
    adt-installer
    meta-ide-support
